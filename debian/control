Description: Eternal Lands is a free MMORPG, this is the client package
 Eternal Lands is a FREE MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role playing
 game). From the website: The game is now in Beta stage, but that doesn't mean
 it's incomplete. It's currently fully playable and we are constantly working on
 adding more things to do, more items to make, monsters to fight, and also
 improving the current systems. If you want to help us in any way, take a look
 in our forums and there you can post your ideas/suggestions, or perhaps even
 get involved with programming or mapmaking which we can always use help with!
