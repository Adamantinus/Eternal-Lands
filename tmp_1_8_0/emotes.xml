<emotes>
<!-- 
	-emotes are contained in <emote id="n"> tags.
	 optionally a barehanded="L/R/B" can be specified (upper case). The emote will be played only if:
		* "L" -> shield not equipped
		* "R" -> weapon not equipped
		* "B" -> weapon and shield not equipped
	 if barehanded is not specified, equipped items are ignored.
	-For each emote you can define multiple commands (<command> tag) of 20 chars max.
	-The <sitting><walking><standing><running> tags are used to specify which frame to use
	 while sitting,waliking...
	 3 properties can be specified:
		* sex: M/F
		* race: human,elf,dwarf,orchan,gnome,draegoni
		* held: 0/false=single actor, 1/true=with attached actor
		if sex is not specified the frame is used for both sexes
		if race is not specified the frame is used for all races
		if held is not specified the frame is used for held & not held actors
	- Inside <sitting><walking>...there goes an integer representing the index of the CAL_emote frame
	  defined in player_frames.xml / -1 to disable
	- the <face> tag is used fo facial expressions and can be omitted. It works as <sitting><walking>...
	  but no held property is specified.
	- if a tag is not given, the corresponding action won't be performed
